/// is useful for debugging and profiling overall game performance -- you can think of it as your
/// server frame time, even though iterations are hard-capped by the `tick_rate` variable.
///
/// If somehow your tick execution time exceeded your tick interval (sleep duration), the game loop
/// would slowly drift off a consistent time, and could affect other systems signifigantly. In
/// practice, though, this would be almost impossible to do. The default 50ms per tick leaves an
/// massive amount of room, even for ineffecient systems or high command processing loads.
///
/// Note: This is a UNIQUE system. It does NOT operate on the system queue, and is baked into the
/// game loop. It will not show up under systems debug output, and cannot be dynamically reloaded.
